<p >If talk about experience, i don't really have any work experience since i never work properly, maybe some part-time to earn extra money.Other than that, i have experience in holding some postion in my diploma and school days such as some important position in association or uniformed unit. I also have entered some sport competition although not that high level. I think the most thing that i remembered is when i become a facilitator in a program. At there, i learn about a lot of things such as how to be a good leader, how to work well in a team or group and many other things</p>
